# Change the following print statement so that it uses the addition operator + and prints out 8
print(3)
my_name = "Munir"
result = 4 + 4
print(result)

# Write a print statement that uses the division operator / 
print(12 / 3)
# Add a print statement that uses multiplication *
print(3 * 4)
# Create a variable called `length` and assign a value to it
length = 13
# Create a variable called    `width` and assign a value to it
width = 15
# Create a variable called `area` and assign to it the multiplication of `length` and `width`
area = width * length
# Print `area` in the following: "The result is " followed by the `area` variable
print(f"The result is {area}")

# BONUS: Print the area in the following syntax: "If the length of a rectangle is 5, and width is 3 then the area is: 15". Keep in mind that you should replace the numbers with their respective variables.
